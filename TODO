Data handling:
- convert regevents to tRNA -> gene regulation
- determine expected fold change from attenuation

Parca changes:
- calculate K from expression change and tRNA concentrations in minimal/rich media
- update basal expression/probs for attenuation effect

Sim changes:
- load data structures from sim_data
- check mass balance and handle properly
