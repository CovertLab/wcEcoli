Data handling:
-x- convert regevents to tRNA -> gene regulation
-x- determine expected fold change from attenuation
- - touch up nca for new changes (allow option for tRNA, uncomment broken code and handle, use tRNA not TF in fold_change output and remove unused columns)

Parca changes:
-x- calculate K from fold change and tRNA concentrations in rich media
-x- update basal probs (adjusted for TFs?) for attenuation effect
- - update ppGpp expression vectors (or synth prob calculation?) for attenuation effect

Sim changes:
-x- load data structures from sim_data
- - check mass balance and handle properly
- - listener for number of aborted transcripts
- - option to run with attenuation or not (also parca option?)

Analysis:
- - plot showing aborted transcripts vs AA and tRNA conc

Checks:
- - check all negative fold changes
- - check why some tRNA are higher in anaerobic than with_aa in parca
