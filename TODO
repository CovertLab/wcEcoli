Data handling:
-x- convert regevents to tRNA -> gene regulation
-x- determine expected fold change from attenuation
- - touch up nca for new changes (allow option for tRNA, uncomment broken code and handle, use tRNA not TF in fold_change output)

Parca changes:
- - calculate K from expression change and tRNA concentrations in minimal/rich media
- - update basal expression/probs for attenuation effect

Sim changes:
- - load data structures from sim_data
- - check mass balance and handle properly
