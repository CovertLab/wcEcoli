- move classes to new directory and separate files
- document functions
- sim error handling
- resume from a given iteration
- run baseline sim without parameter changes for each iteration
  - option to do so
  - return objective
  - track objective over iterations
- use iteration as topline folder (need to keep variants with different sim_data)
  - change top level sims nested under one name
  - run multiple seeds/gens/variants within each parameter change (maybe also nested?)

considerations:
- create workflow dependencies to more easily scale
