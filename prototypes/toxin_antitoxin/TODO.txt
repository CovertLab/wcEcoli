# TO DO LIST TOXIN ANTITOXIN

# * integrate this math into the whole cell model
# ** first, need to implement A and T transcription from an operon
# ** how to model the impact on translation? Start with simple linear modifier?
# *** model cleavage of 16S mRNA on 70S
# *** remove 16S mRNA and add 2 new cleaved isoforms

# ** transcription repression by AT complex

# ** replace N-end rule deg rates with measured deg rates
# *** add to PROTEIN_DEG_RATES_ADJUSTMENTS in fit_sim_data_1

# * identify toxin/antitoxin pairs in e coli
# * figure out which ones are in the model

# * implement leaderless mRNA translation by cleaved 16S rRNA containing ribosomes
# * add mazEF to transcription factor flat file 

# * create new bulk molecule type for MazF cleaved 30S
# * add attribute to activeRibosome unique molecule to signify cleavage
# * deal with cleaved 43nt bit from mazF cleavage : preserve mass balance

# * figure out which mRNAs are leaderless and do they exist in model?
# * modified 70S ribosome doesn't translate normal mRNAs

# * can we also model mazF cleavage of other mRNA

# DONE
# ** A and T concentrations can feed in from protein counts
# ** need to model complexation of AT
# *** need to add complexation reactions for each AT species to sim_data.process.complexation.stoichMatrix()
# *** add AT complex names to sim_data.process.complexation.moleculeNames
# *** get masses of A and T
# *** get keys for A and T
# * focus on mazEF
# * figure out necessary initial conditions 
# * figure out what will be effected 
# * implement Fasani and Savageau 2013 model in prototypes
# ** calculate changes for a given time step
