# TO DO LIST TOXIN ANTITOXIN




# * integrate this math into the whole cell model
# ?? how to model the impact on translation? Start with simple linear modifier?


# * toxin cleavage of mRNA
# ** model cleavage of 16S rRNA on both 30S and 70S
# *** create new bulk molecule type for MazF cleaved 30S
# **** modify new 30S cleaved form molecular weight in reconstruction/ecoli/flat/modifiedForms.tsv
# *** add attribute to activeRibosome unique molecule to signify cleavage
# **** when modified active ribosome decomplexes release modified 16S mRNA (missing 43nt)
# *** deal with cleaved 43nt bit from mazF cleavage : preserve mass balance


# * transcription repression by AT complex
# ** add mazEF to transcription factor flat file 
# >> TF effects seem to be in foldChanges.tsv
# ?? does it need to be in tfOneComponentBound.tsv? > no? Because the TF will be a complex not a metabolite bound form.
# >> tf binding happens here: reconstruction/ecoli/dataclasses/process/transcription_regulation.py

# * need to implement A and T transcription from an operon


# * replace N-end rule deg rates with measured deg rates
# ** add to PROTEIN_DEG_RATES_ADJUSTMENTS in fit_sim_data_1
# ?? no good measurements of deg rates, could measure it experimentally.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# ?? can we also model mazF cleavage of other mRNA

# * find leaderless mRNAs
# * implement leaderless mRNA translation by cleaved 16S rRNA containing ribosomes
# ?? figure out which mRNAs are leaderless and do they exist in model?
# *** important leaderless prots mentioned in Vesper 2011 (in model Y/N): yfiD/EG11784 (Y), yfbU/G7188 (Y), deoC/EG10221 (Y), rsuA/EG12044 (Y) 
# ?? does modified 70S ribosome translate normal mRNAs?

# * identify toxin/antitoxin pairs in e coli (there are 7)
# ** figure out which ones are in the model



# DONE
# ** check translation efficiencies used in model - mazE: 1.01 mazF: 0.39
# ** A and T concentrations can feed in from protein counts
# ** need to model complexation of AT
# *** need to add complexation reactions for each AT species to sim_data.process.complexation.stoichMatrix()
# *** add AT complex names to sim_data.process.complexation.moleculeNames
# *** get masses of A and T
# *** get keys for A and T
# * focus on mazEF
# * figure out necessary initial conditions 
# * figure out what will be effected 
# * implement Fasani and Savageau 2013 model in prototypes
# ** calculate changes for a given time step
