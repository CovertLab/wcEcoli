"tRNA-Leu"	"ilvA"	"Removed for more stable growth with amino acid supply by making ilvA more responsive to low Ile charging."
"tRNA-Val"	"ilvA"	"Val activates enzyme activity which is not included in the model so high Val should have a neutral impact on IlvA activity not just repressing from attenuation."
