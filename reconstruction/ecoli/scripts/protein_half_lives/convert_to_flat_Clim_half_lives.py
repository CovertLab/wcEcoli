"""
Converts sorted files of protein half-lives selected from carbon-limited
conditions in supplementary table S1 of Gupta et al., 2024,
"Global Protein-Turnover Quantification in Escherichia coli Reveals Cytoplasmic
Recycling under Nitrogen Limitation"
(doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-49920-8) to flat files to be used in the
translation.py within the model.

NOTE:
After the new flat file is generated, it must also be added to the list in
knowledge_base_raw.py in order for it to be used in the model.

NOTE: This script uses the EcoCyc monomer IDs that correspond to the UniProt IDs
provided in the Gupta et. al. (2024) dataset. The EcoCyc monomer IDs may update
over time when the model is updated with a new version of EcoCyc, so it is
important to ensure that the EcoCyc monomer IDs are up-to-date from time to time
and generating new EcoCyc monomer ID match files as needed by using the script:
get_current_EcoCyc_monomer_IDs_for_Clim_data.py (in the Gupta_et_al_Clim_data folder).
