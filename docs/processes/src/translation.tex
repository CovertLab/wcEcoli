\paragraph{Translation}

\subparagraph{Model implementation.}
Translation is the process by which the coding sequences of mRNA transcripts are translated by 70S ribosomes into polypeptides that then fold into proteins. This process accounts for more than two thirds of an \emph{E. coli} cell's ATP consumption during rapid growth \cite{Russell:1995vc} and the majority of macromolecular mass accumulation. In the \emph{E. coli} model  translation occurs through the action of two processes in the model: \texttt{PolypeptideInitiation} and \texttt{PolypeptideElongation}.

\subparagraph{Initiation.}
\texttt{PolypeptideInitiation} models the complementation of 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits into 70S ribosomes on mRNA transcripts. This process is in many ways analogous to the \texttt{TranscriptInitiation} process - the number of initiation events per transcript is determined in a probabilistic manner and dependent on the number of free ribosomal subunits, each mRNA transcript's translation efficiency, and the counts of each type of transcript. The total number of ribosomes to activate in each time step is determined such that the average fraction of actively translating ribosomes matches experimental values. This is done by assuming a steady state concentration of active ribosomes (and therefore a constant active fraction), similar to what was done for RNA polymerases in \texttt{TranscriptInitiation}:
\begin{gather}
    \frac{dR_{70S}}{dt} = p_{act}\cdot \min(R_{30S}, R_{50S}) - r \cdot R_{70S} = 0 \\
    p_{act} = \frac{r \cdot R_{70S}}{\min(R_{30S}, R_{50S})}
\end{gather}
\noindent where $R_{70S}$ is the concentration of active 70S ribosomes, $R_{50S}$ and $R_{30S}$ are the concentrations of free 50S and 30S ribosomal subunits, respectively, $p_{act}$ is the activation probability and $r$ is the expected termination rate for active 70S ribosomes. Defining the active fraction as $f_{act} = \frac{R_{70S}}{R_{70S} + \min(R_{30S}, R_{50S})}$, $p_{act}$ can be defined in terms of the desired active fraction:
\begin{equation}
    p_{act} = \frac{r\cdot f_{act}}{1 - f_{act}}
\end{equation}
This activation probability is then used to determine how many 70S ribosomes will be formed and initiated. These newly initiated 70S ribosomes are distributed to mRNA transcripts based on their translation probabilities, which is computed by normalizing the product of the translational efficiency of each transcript and the counts of each transcript.
\begin{equation}
p_i = \frac{c_{mRNA,i} \cdot t_i}{\sum\limits^{n_{gene}}_{j=1} c_{mRNA,j} \cdot t_j}
\end{equation}
Here, $p_i$ is the translation probability of the transcript of gene $i$, $c_{mRNA,i}$ is the count of the transcript of gene $i$, and $t_i$ is the translation efficiency of the transcript of gene $i$.  The translational efficiencies of each transcript were calculated from ribosomal profiling data \cite{li2014quantifying}. For transcripts whose translation efficiencies were not given in this dataset, the average of the existing efficiency values was used as the translation efficiency. Full 70S ribosomes are formed on mRNA transcripts by sampling a multinomial distribution with the $p_i$'s calculated above as the probabilistic weights (See Algorithm \ref{polypeptide_initiation_algorithm}).

This process is implemented similarly in the \emph{M. genitalium} model with a few key differences. Unlike the \emph{M. genitalium} model, the \emph{E. coli} model is not yet gene complete, and hence does not check for initiation factors. A major advancement over the \emph{M. genitalium} model is that the probability of ribosome initiation on a transcript is now proportional to the product of the mRNA count and its translational efficiency. In the \emph{M. genitalium} model translational efficiencies were not taken into account.

\subparagraph{Elongation.}
\texttt{PolypeptideElongation} models the polymerization of amino acids into polypeptides by ribosomes using an mRNA transcript as a template, and the termination of elongation once a ribosome has reached the end of an mRNA transcript. This process is implemented assuming that tRNA charging by synthetases, ternary complex formation (GTP : EF-Tu : charged-tRNA), and ternary complex diffusion to elongating ribosomes are not rate limiting for polypeptide polymerization. Given this assumption this process directly polymerizes amino acids based on the codon sequence of the mRNA transcript. Polymerization occurs across all ribosomes simultaneously and resources are allocated to maximize the progress of all ribosomes within the limits of the maximum ribosome elongation rate, available amino acids and GTP, and the length of the transcript (see Algorithm \ref{polypeptide_elongation_algorithm}).

Under our simulation conditions, we empirically observe that the rate of translation elongation is always limited by the supply of amino acids, not by the elongation rates of ribosomes or the supply of GTP. Thus, the rate at which amino acids are supplied to translation largely determines the synthesis rates of proteins, which in turn is highly correlated with the growth rate of the cell. We have therefore added an option to add Gaussian noise to this supply rate of amino acids to translation, in cases where heterogeneity in growth rates between individual simulations would be a desired outcome.

Unlike the \emph{M. genitalium} model, this process in the \emph{E. coli} model does not account for elongation factors. Additionally, tRNAs and their synthetases are not accounted for explicitly. Instead, the model directly polymerizes amino acids into elongating polypeptides. This avoids computational issues with the simulation time step, tRNA pool size, and tRNA overexpression that were present in the \emph{M. genitalium} model. There is no implementation of ribosome stalling or tmRNAs at this point. The polymerization resource allocation algorithm is the same as in \emph{M. genitalium}.\\
