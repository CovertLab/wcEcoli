# Background on the Whole Cell Model

* One implicit modeling design goal is that no phenomena be modeled in more than one place over a given time interval -- exactly one place, if the model is complete.

* We have to be careful about degrees of representation. E.g. genes with known differential expression but no associated transcription factor do not currently change their expression during an environmental shift.

* A reproducible/testable way to show what is or isn't represented is via validation against some expected behavior or withheld data set.
