# Whole Cell Model of E. coli

These are the docs for a variety of topics on the Whole Cell Model.

## setup

There are two alternative ways to set up to run the model:

1. **Docker setup (recommended):** Install the [Docker Desktop software](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) then launch our Docker container image from the GitHub Package Registry or build it locally using the `cloud/build-containers.sh` shell script.

   You can then run the model inside the container and link your local directory to the one inside the Docker container (`<local wcEcoli>` denotes the local path to your cloned repo):

   ```docker run --name=wcm -v <local wcEcoli>:/wcEcoli -it wcm-code```

   By doing so, the output files in the Docker folder (`/wcEcoli/out`) will also be linked to a corresponding folder in your computer (`<local wcEcoli>/out`). The files will be owned by `root` user so you might need to `chmod`/`chgrp` if you have permissions issues.

   **NOTE:** You may need to run the command `make clean compile` once inside the container before running simulations if you mount the volume from the host with the `-v` option as above.

   **NOTE:** If you encounter memory issues while using Docker Desktop (the default allocated memory is 2GB) and the simulation processes get killed midway, click the Docker icon > Preferences > Advanced > adjust memory to 4GB.

   **NOTE:** Docker Desktop for Windows is not currently compatible with VirtualBox.  If you use VirtualBox, try installing the legacy [Docker Toolbox](https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases) instead.  You may also need to adjust the memory allocated to the VirtualBox VM (named 'default') that gets created.  In VirtualBox, select the 'default' VM and under system, change the base memory from 1 GB to 4 GB.

2. **pyenv setup:** Follow [Required development tools](dev-tools.md) to install the development tools including pyenv, gcc, make, and git, then follow [Creating the "pyenv" runtime environment](create-pyenv.md) to set up the Python runtime virtual environment for the model including binary libraries and Python packages.

   You can then run the model with this version of Python under `pyenv`.
   
   If you have Anaconda installed, you might have to take it off the `$PATH` temporarily to run the Whole Cell Model.

   This approach takes many careful steps that vary depending on your operating system. It will run â‰ˆ1 dB faster than inside a container.
